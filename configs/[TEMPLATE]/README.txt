Go threw the Server and Client files and replace the CHANGEME value to that name set in the config

Config = {
    ['logistics'] = {
        DefaultEntitySet = 'gcom_lc_garage_1', --JUST BE A YBN
        InteriorCoords = {x = 1889.01,  y = 3141.22, z = 44.69},
        EntitySetBaseName = 'gcom_lc_garage_',--JUST BE A YBN
        ComamndName = 'logistics_toggle'
    }
}

EX: CHANGEME would be set to logistics
